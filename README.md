# Visual-Pollution-Saudi-Roads

## Overview

This repository provides a **deep learning model** aimed at detecting and classifying road features such as **barriers**, **sidewalks**, and **potholes** in images. The model uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for **real-time object detection** and includes performance evaluation with metrics like **confusion matrices**. The project focuses on both **image classification** and **bounding box localization** tasks, aimed at identifying and localizing road features for better understanding and management.

This model is intended for developers and researchers interested in real-time object detection for road features, and it provides a base for further optimization and exploration.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of **barriers**, **sidewalks**, and **potholes**. These images are manually annotated to help the model classify and detect these road features efficiently. The dataset was utilized to train and evaluate the model’s performance in both classification and bounding box localization tasks.

The dataset contains a variety of road images with different lighting, angles, and conditions, which provides a challenge for the model to generalize well.

## Model Description

The core of this project is based on the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** algorithm, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model. YOLO is designed to predict multiple bounding boxes and the corresponding class labels from the input image in a single pass.

### **Model Highlights:**

* **YOLO Architecture** is used to classify **barriers**, **sidewalks**, and **potholes** in road images.
* The model predicts **bounding boxes** and **classification labels** for each detected feature.
* YOLO allows the model to operate in **real-time**, making it suitable for applications such as autonomous vehicles and traffic management systems.

## Performance and Results

### **1. Bounding Box Localization Confusion Matrix (IoU >= 0.5)**

This confusion matrix evaluates the performance of the model for **bounding box localization** using an **Intersection over Union (IoU)** threshold of **>= 0.5**. It evaluates how accurately the predicted bounding boxes overlap with the ground truth boxes. The matrix shows:

* **True positives** (1782): These are the correctly predicted objects.
* **False positives** (456): Instances where the model incorrectly predicted an object.
* **False negatives** (4121): Instances where the model failed to detect the object.

This indicates that while the model can detect certain road features, the localization of these features is still not accurate enough for real-world applications.

### **2. Classification Confusion Matrix**

The classification confusion matrix shows the results for classifying the road features into **barriers**, **sidewalks**, and **potholes**. Here’s a summary of the performance:

* **Potholes** are classified correctly most of the time, but **sidewalks** and **barriers** suffer from significant misclassifications.
* **Sidewalks** and **barriers** are often misclassified as **potholes**, reflecting a need for better feature separation and better training for these features.

### **3. Object Detection Results**

The detection results show how the model detects road features, represented by **bounding boxes**. The **true labels** are marked with **green boxes**, while **predicted labels** are marked with **red boxes**. The visual outputs demonstrate that the model correctly detects **potholes** but struggles with **sidewalks** and **barriers**.

* **True positives**: The model correctly identifies objects, especially potholes.
* **False positives/negatives**: The model misidentifies or fails to identify sidewalk and barrier objects, indicating that more data or a different architecture may improve these detections.

---

## Challenges Identified:

1. **Misclassification**: The model struggles with distinguishing **sidewalks** and **barriers** from **potholes**, often misclassifying them due to similarities in appearance or insufficient feature extraction.
2. **Localization**: Bounding box localization has notable issues, with **false negatives** being quite high, which means the model is missing many objects or misplacing the bounding boxes.

## Model Improvement Strategies

### **1. Data Augmentation**:

* **Expand the dataset** by using **data augmentation techniques** such as rotation, scaling, cropping, flipping, and color jittering. This can help the model generalize better to unseen data.
* Consider incorporating **synthetic data** using generative models to create more examples of rare road features (e.g., cracks or damage in sidewalks).

### **2. Use of Advanced Architectures**:

* Experiment with **YOLOv4**, **YOLOv5**, or other state-of-the-art architectures like **EfficientDet** or **Faster R-CNN** for improved detection accuracy, especially for smaller objects like **sidewalks** and **barriers**.
* **Multi-scale feature extraction** could help improve the detection of smaller features.

### **3. Hyperparameter Tuning**:

* **Tune hyperparameters** such as **learning rate**, **batch size**, and **number of epochs** to optimize the model's training process.
* Experiment with **IoU thresholds** and **anchor box sizes** to better capture the object shapes and sizes.

### **4. Incorporating Attention Mechanisms**:

* Use **attention mechanisms** to allow the model to focus more on the relevant parts of the image, such as **sidewalks** and **barriers**, which may be smaller or have less contrast compared to **potholes**.

### **5. Ensemble Methods**:

* **Combine multiple models** (e.g., YOLO + Faster R-CNN) to leverage the strengths of each, which could improve both classification and localization performance.

### **6. Post-Processing Techniques**:

* Use **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)** to remove duplicate bounding boxes for each object.
* Incorporate **Class Activation Mapping (CAM)** or **Grad-CAM** to visualize which parts of the image the model is focusing on, ensuring that it is paying attention to the right features.

## Conclusion

While the model shows reasonable performance in detecting **potholes**, its **classification accuracy** and **bounding box localization** for **sidewalks** and **barriers** leave much to be desired. The results from the **confusion matrices** and **object detection outputs** reveal the need for significant improvements.
